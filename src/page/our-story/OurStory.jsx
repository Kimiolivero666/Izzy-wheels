                                <p>Izzy Wheels was founded by Irish sisters Ailbhe (pronounced Alva) and Izzy Keane. The pair grew up in Galway, a beautiful seaside city in the west of Ireland.</p>
                                <p>In 2016 Ailbhe, who was studying at The National College of Art and Design (NCAD), chose to design a range of removable wheel covers that matched her sister's coloruful style. The idea was inspired by Izzy who was born with Spina Bifida and is paralyzed from her waist down. Izzy has always seen her wheelchair as a symbol of freedom but never felt it expressed her personality.
                                </p>
                                <p>The sisters created a video showcasing their unique wheel cover designs which went viral online (17 million views in one week) and their brand exploded.</p>

                                        <p>"Our mission with Izzy Wheels is to challenge negative associations with wheelchairs and let users celebrate their individuality by personalizing their source of independence. We want to show the world that wheelchairs can be so much more than a medical device, they can be a piece of artistic self-expression"

                                        <p>"Izzy Wheels empower wheelchair users to make a statement about themselves, it makes a person's wheelchair into a friendly object rather than something purely functional. Having stylish wheels on your chair that match your outfit or show off your interests immediately addresses the chair and opens conversation"
